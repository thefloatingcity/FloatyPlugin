As did [Helios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios), the god personifying the sun in
[Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology),
confiscate Icarus of his ability to fly, so too does Helios prevent players in
[The Floating City](https://thefloating.city) from using creative mode flight.

More broadly, Helios implements all of The Floating City's custom functionality.
Ranging from flight restriction to custom world generation, Helios' features are
uniquely written for The Floating City, so Helios does not have much use elsewhere.
